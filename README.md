###Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs
####By Amelia Kaufman

You must act quickly! Food has started raining from the sky. You must stop the meatballs before they hit the ground! It may seem like an easy task at first, but as time goes on more food will fall and the challenge will get more difficult. Destroy 10 meatballs and you win! Miss one, and lose the game.
